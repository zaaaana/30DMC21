My attempts at the 30 Day Map Challenge for November 2021!

This is a GitHub repo for all the maps created for this challenge. This was my first time participating and I'm so excited / proud that I was able to complete a map a day! My main goals with this challenge were to:

- Relearn old techniques
- Learn new techniques, software, and styles
- Submit _something_ each day, even if it's a quick and easy 5-min map!

Thanks to this challenge, I've definitely gained skills in GIS and mapping that I never thought I'd be able to manage. I've also connected with some amazing people within the field and I'm so thankful for the network opportunity this provided.

I've been posting my maps daily on both [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/zaaaana) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Zaaaana_) and I'm happy to connect on both platforms!
