## 30 Day Map Challenge: by Zaana!

This is a quick website for all the maps I've made for 2021's [30 Day Map Challenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge). This is my first year participating and I've had a blast!

Even though it was not a requirement, I managed to complete a map for each day. My main motivations for this challenge were to revisit old techniques, learn new ones, and try to create whatever I can, even if it were a map done in 5 minutes' time!

This was an amazing opportunity to build my confidence in mapping, as well as network with some amazing people in the field! I am a fan of every single person who made something this month, and I can't wait to see what everyone gets up to in the future.

I also posted my maps daily on both [Twitter](http://twitter.com/zaaaana_) and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/zaaaana), so feel free to connect with me on either platform!

Now, let's get into it!
